// data strcuture to store a collection of variables of the same type


// the first [] is used to tell compiler we are declaring an array
// second is used to set the size of the array
int[] numbers = new int[3];
numbers[0] = 1;
numbers[1] = 2;
numbers[2] = 3;

//OR

int[] numbers2 = new int[3] {1, 2, 3};




// arrays have a fixed size and it cannot be changed
// need to use new to allocate new memory

// it is really an object behind the screen
// the compiler creates an instance
